# GIC-for-SJM
This repository provides R functions dedicated to calculating the Generalized Information Criterion (GIC) for sparse statistical jump models (SJM). 

## Utils
The "Utils" file encompasses a suite of R functions essential for GIC computations. It is crucial to ensure that the "SJ.py" file is present in the working directory for the GIC functions to operate correctly.

## sim_run
The "sim_run" file is responsible for executing all simulation studies associated with this project.
