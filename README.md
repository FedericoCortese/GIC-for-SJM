# GIC-for-SJM
This repository provides R functions dedicated to calculating the Generalized Information Criterion (GIC) for sparse statistical jump models (SJM). 

# Utils
The "Utils" file encompasses a suite of R functions essential for GIC computations. It is crucial to ensure that the "SJ.py" file is present in the working directory for the GIC functions to operate correctly. It contains the following functions:

### SJM_est 
This function estimates the parameters of the SJM model.

### sim_data
Function to simulate data from a multivariate Gaussian HMM.

# est_example
The "est_example" file provides a simple example of estimating an SJM and computing the GIC for model selection.
